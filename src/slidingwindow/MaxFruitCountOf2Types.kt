/**
 * Problem Statement: Fruits into Baskets
 *  Given an array of characters where each character represents a fruit tree,
 *  you are given two baskets, and your goal is to put maximum number of fruits
 *  in each basket. The only restriction is that each basket can have only one
 *  type of fruit.
 *
 *  You can start with any tree, but you canâ€™t skip a tree once you have started.
 *  You will pick one fruit from each tree until you cannot, i.e., you will stop
 *  when you have to pick from a third fruit type.
 *
 *  Write a function to return the maximum number of fruits in both baskets.
 *
 *  Example 1:
 *      Input: Fruit=['A', 'B', 'C', 'A', 'C']
 *      Output: 3
 *      Explanation: We can put 2 'C' in one basket and one 'A' in the other from the subarray ['C', 'A', 'C']
 *
